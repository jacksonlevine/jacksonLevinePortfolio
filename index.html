  <h1><span class="exciting">About Me:</span></h1>
  <p>My name is Jackson, I am a 23-year-old programming enthusiast! I have worked various jobs including landscaping, cashier work, and food service, but have become more excited by programming over the last few years, at first just wanting to type on a keyboard for fun, but soon in awe of what can be done with relatively easy logic that felt intuitive to me!</p>

  </div>
    <p>This was my first time realizing that you can make a program that does anything! Being inspired by my years spent playing Minecraft, I attempted to write a similar game using the C# console. I later moved on to Unity Game Engine and continued learning more ways to code in the process!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Aside from coding, I am a lover of music and coffee. I wake up every day with a song that I need to hear that day, I couldn't do without it!</p>
