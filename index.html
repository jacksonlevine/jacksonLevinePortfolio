  <h1><span class="exciting">About Me:</span></h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Jackson, I am a 23-year-old programmer! I have worked various jobs including landscaping, cashier work, and food service, but have become more excited by programming over my lifetime, at first just wanting to type on a keyboard for fun, but soon in awe of what can be done with relatively easy logic that felt intuitive to me!</p>

  </div>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first time realizing that you can make a program that does anything! Being inspired by my years spent playing Minecraft, I attempted to write a similar game using the C# console. I later moved on to Unity Game Engine and continued learning more ways to code in the process.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from coding, I am a <strong>lover</strong> of music and coffee. I wake up every day with a song that I <strong>need</strong> to hear that day, I couldn't do without it! Some of my favorite bands to listen to are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Beatles</li>
    <li>Doobie Brothers</li>
    <li>Beach Boys</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And if I had to rank my favorite movies in order...</p>
  <ol>
    <li>2001 A Space Odyssey</li>
    <li>The Shining</li>
    <li>Goodfellas</li>
  </ol>
